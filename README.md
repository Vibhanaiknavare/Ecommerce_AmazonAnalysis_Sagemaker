# Ecommerce_AmazonAnalysis on AWS Sagemaker and Quicksight
This project was executed on Amazon SageMaker for machine learning modeling and visualized using Amazon QuickSight for interactive dashboards. Using a combination of machine learning models and clustering techniques, the analysis aimed to predict order cancellations and segment customers based on their purchasing behaviors. A Random Forest model was employed to predict the likelihood of order cancellations, achieving an accuracy of 95.62% with high precision and recall. For customer segmentation, K-Means clustering identified two distinct customer groups, each with unique purchasing patterns and category preferences. These insights enable targeted marketing and operational strategies to reduce cancellations and enhance customer satisfaction. The results provide valuable business intelligence for improving sales performance and customer engagement, demonstrating the power of integrating data science tools and visualization platforms to derive actionable insights.
